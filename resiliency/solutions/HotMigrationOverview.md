## {{site.SoA}} + Precisely for High Availability Scenarios

For hot migrations, {{site.Brand}} partners with Precisely, the market leader for high availability scenarios. Precisely supports IBM i and AIX. How Precisely supports the {{site.SoA}} hot migration for IBM i is depicted below.

### What is Precisely for IBM iSeries?

- Precisely's MIMIX is the most prevalent tool used in RPO scenarios of near-zero
- Easy to Package – Support for both AIX and IBM i
- Automated Role Swaps Allow for Testing, Operations Upgrades in Prod
- AIX Solution Provides Live Snapshot Capability for Any Subsidiary Environment Seeding

This is built on IBM's remote journaling which replicates changed data in real-time and minimizes bandwidth usage. The MIMIX change data capture replicates non-journaled data. This solution is flexible and platform independent because it supports mixed hardware, storage and IBM i OS version. It is also optimized for performance because it:

-   delivers near-zero RPO (zero with synchronous Remote Journaling)

-   provides near-zero RTO by maintaining a hot, switch-ready back up

-   includes performance tuning features to optimize performance for
    your environment (i.e. parallel applies and database caching)

-   has active-active replication with built-in conflict resolution that
    delivers RTO in seconds (as quickly as moving users to another
    active server)

The following outlines popular Precisely migration scenarios available for you to consider:

### What's different about AIX?

- The AIX Mimix Product focuses on Volume Group replication and sync
- Any applications encapsulated in the Volume Group are included as part of the replication
- The Root Volume Group is NOT Replicated (Needs to be Handled Separately) [There are some known scripts for handling initial sync of Root Volume Group]
- Point in Time Snapshot of Volume Groups
- Inline Encryption
