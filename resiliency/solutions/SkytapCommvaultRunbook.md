## Key Takeaways<a name="takeaways"></a>

Commvault may be used to migrate, protect, and recover IBM i LPARs on {{site.Brand}} for Azure. This guide will walk you through all the steps required to get up and running with Commvault in {{site.Brand}}.

Here is an overview of how {{site.SoA}} and Commvault work together
for AIX and IBM i (as400).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skytap/well-architected-framework/master/resiliency/migrationmedia/media/image8.png">

For the overall architecture, please refer to the sample reference architecture shown below. In the example shown in *Figure 1*, a 1--*n* set of IBM i LPARs resides on-premises in a data center facility. In the example architecture, Commvault is used to back up the IBM i selected LPAR data to Commvault proxy MediaAgents to be transferred to Azure Blob Storage. The Commvault CommServer controls the orchestration and automation of the backup within Azure. The data, once transferred, may then be restored to {{site.Brand}} for Azure, unchanged.

### Deploying the Commvault MediaAgent Proxy on an Ubuntu x86 VM as a Decoupled install and connecting it to the CommServer.

Our next step is from within the {{site.Brand}} environment, where we will add a
Linux Operating System VM that will serve as the Commvault MediaAgent
Proxy within the environment.

For the purpose of this guide, we will make occasional reference to
Ubuntu 20.04 running on POWER, but it is recommended that you use any of
the other Ubuntu x86 VM images, such as **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server 64-bit
-- Firstboot**. These x86 VM images are all fully supported -- including
deduplication, which is not supported under POWER.

> *To support the backup of IBM i, a Linux OS for the Commvault
> MediaAgent is required. \[For a list of supported operating systems,
> please refer to <a href="https://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=2822_1.htm" target="_blank">Commvault MediaAgent Requirements Guide</a>.\]*

26. Close the **Add New Client** pop-up.

27. Click on the LPAR of your choice.

    a.  Check the status of the Overview screen to verify your settings.

    b.  Check the status of the Configuration screen.

    c.  Check with your IBM Administrator to see when an appropriate
        backup window exists to test the first backup.

**Please note: A backup of the critical system components will reset the
system to Restricted State and prevent software applications from
operating.**

**Do not run OS-level data protection operations outside of backup
windows.**

d.  **Make sure that you associate the Data Storage to each subclient
    for the LPAR. (Through Java GUI, right-click properties on default
    FileSet or created Subclient file set).**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skytap/well-architected-framework/master/resiliency/protectionmedia/media2/image78.png">

Familiarize yourself with the pre-defined user sub-clients:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skytap/well-architected-framework/master/resiliency/protectionmedia/media2/image79.png">

DRSubclient is not supported at this time. Backing up all sub-clients
(but not DR Subclient) will backup the entirety of the LPAR but not the
IBM I licensing. **PLEASE NOTE: Before the full backup, ensure PTFs are
updated to Match the Target LPAR in {{site.Brand}} -- OS version must also
match.**

All other sub-clients (**\*ALLDLO**, **\*ALLUSR**, **\*IBM**, **\*HST
log**, and **\*LINK**) will use Save-while-active and not send the
system into Restricted mode.

### Run a backup (Right click through Java GUI on FileSystem for LPAR)

a.  <a href="https://documentation.commvault.com/11.21/essential/108610_performing_ibm_i_file_system_backups.html" target="_blank">https://documentation.commvault.com/11.21/essential/108610_performing_ibm_i_file_system_backups.html</a>

b.  Click on any of the sub-clients you wish to protect under the
    Actions tab and select Back up. If this is your first backup select
    'Full' for your protection level.

c.  You can monitor the status of the backups from the Jobs tab off of
    the primary Ribbon.

28. Once the backups have finished successfully, you can be confident
    that the automatic schedule as part of the Plan will run as expected
    and you will have regular good data protection operations.

Use case #2 -- Data Recovery using Web Interface (Can also be done
through Java GUI).

Bringing data back to an IBM I system in the cloud is very easy. Once
the data is stored on the Commvault back-end, it can be written back to
any of our systems with an IBMi client. This can be the same system the
data was on when it started, or another system in the same cloud, or a
system in a completely different cloud, or even back on-premises.

Full step-by-step instructions on how to recover data using Commvault
can be found by searching Commvault's documentation website located at:
<a href="https://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/" target="_blank">https://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/</a> and do a keyword search for "IBMi Restore"

Within the Commvault GUI, Now that the data has been protected in the
cloud, you can begin the process of recovering the folders back into the
target guest:

1.  Open the Commvault Command center and browse to the IBM i machine
    that you have protected.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skytap/well-architected-framework/master/resiliency/protectionmedia/media2/image80.png" width="800">

2.  Select the first of the sub-clients whose data you wish to recover.
    Drill inside and select Restore.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skytap/well-architected-framework/master/resiliency/protectionmedia/media2/image81.png" width="800">

3.  Select all of the data, and then target an IBM i machine to recover
    the data to. This machine must have a Commvault agent installed on
    it. If this is disaster recovery or migration, deploy a fresh
    machine in {{site.Brand}} from a template to be the target, and install the
    CommVault agent so that the machine is visible within the Commvault
    GUI

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skytap/well-architected-framework/master/resiliency/protectionmedia/media2/image82.png" width="500">

4.  Run the restore job. Target the destination machine.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skytap/well-architected-framework/master/resiliency/protectionmedia/media2/image83.png" width="500">

5.  Repeat steps 2-4 until you have recovered each of the Commvault
    subclients (not including the DR subclient, which is for authoring
    DVDs)

##### Migration/DR use case: 
Now that the user data has been restored onto the server, the customer can decide to keep the existing IP address
 and hostname, or to reset the server to the identity of the original machine.

***NOTE***: *Manual steps are required to change the IP address and hostname to match the original server. These steps are detailed in the IBM Power series guides. Users should also check the status of any private authorities that existed in the environment.*
