## Security as a Service

Given the breadth of security controls available across multiple cloud
vendors, the changing threat landscape, and the need to support modern
and legacy workloads in the enterprise space, it can be difficult for
organizations to provide those services internally.

{{site.Brand}} works with a variety of Security as a Service vendors who can
manage your cloud workloads and who have expert knowledge in securing
cloud workloads. These partners can supplement an organization's
internal security support team and should be considered as part of a
wider cloud strategy.
