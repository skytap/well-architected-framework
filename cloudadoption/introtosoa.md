**An Introduction to {{site.SoA}}**

Get cloud scale value for IBM Power Workloads

There are many reasons organizations want to move applications to the
cloud including:

-   Digital Transformation efforts to leverage cloud native tools

-   Data center exit

-   Looking to reduce on-premises cost of hardware and software

-   Shifting from capital expenditures to operational expenditures

-   Resilience/Scale

-   Mergers and Acquisitions

Public cloud use cases include:

-   Production: run production AIX, IBM I, Linux, and Windows with
    99.95% availability and secure connectivity to on-premises apps.

-   Disaster recovery: run cold, warm, or hot disaster recovery
    environments to ensure business continuity.

-   Development/Testing: increase developer productivity, test coverage,
    and accelerate DevOps adoption with on-demand application
    environments.

-   Virtual labs: Educate and train customers and sales teams with
    on-demand virtual training labs.

-   Demos and POCs: Rapidly create functioning demos and proofs of
    concepts that prospective customers can test drive without IT
    support.

According to IBM AIX Executive Guide for AIX on Power 2019, business
running on IBM Power Systems today include:

-   Eight out to ten top banking companies

-   Nine out of ten top insurance companies

-   Eight out of ten top healthcare companies

-   Eight out of ten top retailers

Organizations have business-critical applications running on traditional
on-premises IBM Power Platforms. These have proven performance and are
inter-connected and often complex. Organizations seek to evolve these
applications in the cloud to realize cloud-scale benefits, business
agility and innovation, and minimize costs and risk.
