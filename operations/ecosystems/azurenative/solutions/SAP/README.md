This reference architecture illustrates a set of proven practices for running SAP NetWeaver on AIX in a {{site.SoA}} environment. The database in this example is Oracle 19C, but Database Tier may be AnyDB (supported by underlying AIX operating system and SAP NetWeaver).

## Business Drivers - the case for change
**SAP NetWeaver based workloads on IBM Power on {{site.SoA}}**

1.  Business Continuity: NetWeaver workloads requiring Cloud Backup/DR
2.  Regulation and Compliance: NetWeaver workloads in read-only state in Azure
3.  IBM Power Data Center exit : NetWeaver workloads to Azure
4.  Modernization of Business Processes:

    a.  Move NetWeaver workloads to {{site.SoA}} to enable them to inter-operate
 with SAP HANA based workloads or other Business Applications running on Azure

    b.  Move NetWeaver workloads to {{site.SoA}} to enable them to be more easily transition to SAP HANA

## Sample SAP Architecture for {{site.SoA}}

The first diagram shows SAP NetWeaver migration options and running state considerations from a high level with detailed descriptions on options for migration.

The second diagram provides specific recommendations on the overall architectural design and components used for the migration, including Azure native components working in conjunction with {{site.SoA}} dedicated IBM POWER systems.

The numbers in the diagram correspond to the following data flow.
1.	A user on-premises uses a web browser to connect to Azure through Azure ExpressRoute, which creates a private connection. This web-based app provides a modern interface for the services that run on the AIX LPARs in {{site.SoA}}.
2.	Azure Data Box Gateway is deployed on-premises next to the datacenter's existing AIX infrastructure, which includes a temporary AIX Network Installation Management (NIM) server for the purposes of full backup and full restore. Data Box Gateway loads the data and completes the system restoration on Azure. AIX backups run using the operating system's native mksyb and savevg commands.
3.	Files that are backed up to Data Box Gateway are migrated to the organization's Azure Blob Storage account through Azure Private Link, an endpoint for privately accessing Azure services.
4.	In the {{site.SoA}} environment, the NIM server running Unix is used to restore the base AIX operating system to the LPARs in {{site.SoA}}.
5.	The AIX LPAR is rebooted. Any data volume groups are restored through the Data Box Gateway via the Network File System (NFS) protocol. This process is repeated for each LPAR to be restored.

The third diagram is an illustration of utilizating Commvault Backup 
and Recovery for both the migration and for the on-going orchestration of backups in Azure blob storage.

1.	A user on-premises uses a web browser to connect to Azure through Azure ExpressRoute, which creates a private connection. This web-based app provides a modern interface for the services that run on the AIX LPARs in {{site.SoA}}.
2.	Azure Data Box Gateway is deployed on-premises next to the datacenter's existing AIX infrastructure, which includes a Commvault Media Agent. Full and incremental backups of both the SAP NetWeaver Central Services and Application Servers, as well as the Oracle DB are applied to the Commvault Media Agent and then moved to the Azure Data Box Gateway.
3.	In addition to providing the automation for the initial full backup for the migration, A Commvault CommServer in Azure will also orchestrate the backup policy that applies to the running SAP NetWeaver and Oracle DB in the {{site.SoA}}.
4.	Data from the initial full backup, as well as any incremental backups are stored in an organizationâ€™s Azure Blob Storage account.
5.	Reading from the Commvault Media Agent in the {{site.SoA}} environment, both full AIX LPARs, as well as incremental file and DB backups may be restored to the AIX LPARs running in {{site.SoA}}.


Lastly, the final 
diagram brings many of these components together in a diagram of a highly available solution with replication between 
Azure geographic regions for SAP NetWeaver and Oracle on AIX.

The numbers in the diagram correspond to the following data flow.
1.	The three layers represent application, database and optional protection that comprise the entirety of the SAP application stack. Each of these components within {{site.SoA}} may be asynchronously replicated to other Azure regions for Highly Available failover and Disaster Recovery scenarios. In the example above, Primary is represented by West Europe (Amsterdam) and secondary is North Europe (Dublin).
2.	Using an express route connection, Precisely MIMIX for AIX may be used for seamless TCP/IP replication between regions. In some cases, particularly when consistently large rates of data change occur, Oracle Data Guard may be used for Oracle standby replication between regions over a TCP/IP connection via ExpressRoute. In such a case, Precisely MIMIX for AIX would still handle volume group replication between regions for other application components.
3.	In addition to the highly available solution utilizing replication, a protection solution may also be utilized for rollback operations at a transactional, file or bare metal layer. In this example, backups are orchestrated utilizing Commvault writing directly through an access node to geo-redundant (GRS) blob storage in Azure.
4.	Lastly, a mirrored architecture exists within the secondary region, North Europe. This allows for seamless failover in the event of a disaster and an uninterrupted cadence of protection orchestration.
