### What is the IBM Power Estate?

All organizations have some type of digital estate which is a collection
of assets that include their virtual machines (VMs), physical servers,
applications, and data. All of these assets power the organization
and its operations. 

For those organizations with an investment in IBM
Power, we look at segmenting the overall digital estate to the Power
estate. While functionally similar, the terminology can be slightly
different. 

An organization's Power estate is comprised of:

* **IBM Power Systems** (sometimes called frames): IBM Power Systems
    are the physical servers that Power workloads and their applications
    run on.

* **Power VM**: Power VM is the virtualization engine that runs on IBM
    Power Hardware.

* **LPARs (Logical Partitions)**: The LPAR is analogous to the
    Virtual Machine, or VM on x86.

* **Storage**: While smaller organizations may use storage local to the Power
    System, most larger deployments use fiber attached storage to a
    Storage Area Network (SAN).

* **Virtual IO Systems**: This is something most commonly called VIOS
    (Virtual Input Output System). VIOS provides network and storage
    connectivity for the LPARs running on a given Power System.

#### Current Cloud Rationalization and IBM Power Workloads

IBM Power Workloads have been in use for over thirty years and have
unique considerations when migrating them to a Cloud Platform. 

The common <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/digital-estate/5-rs-of-rationalization" target="_blank">Cloud rationalization</a> approach for x86 workloads also apply to Power:

* **Rehost**: This is commonly referred to as a lift of shift of existing
    workloads into a Cloud provider with minimal change to the original
    architecture.

* **Refactor**: In application refactoring, organizations will rewrite one
    or more application components to take advantage of native Cloud
    services.

* **Rebuild**: In some cases, it isn't cost effective to refactor or
    rehost an application due to an aging code base, or a lack of
    knowledge as to how the legacy system works. In this case, the
    organization may decide to start from scratch and create a new
    version of the application completely rearchitected from the ground
    up into a native Cloud-based application that leverages native
    services.

* **Replace**: With the advent of newer Cloud-native SaaS based
    applications, organizations may decide to simply purchase an
    entirely new application and sunset the original legacy application.

* **Retire**: Through application discovery, the organization may
    determine that the application is no longer needed, and/or there is
    overlap with other applications. In this case, the application can
    simply be "turned off".

### Updated Cloud Rationalization and IBM Power Workloads 

Prior to existence of {{site.SoA}}, organizations would consider all of the
approaches above for their Power applications, but after years of
organization moving their applications to the Cloud, there are still thousands of 
applications running in the data center that are
increasingly becoming stuck where they are. In this case, organizations
do not want to make the investment to rearchitect, rebuild, replace, or
retire them. The ability to now run IBM Power applications in
hyper-scale Cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure has changed the
landscape of Cloud rationalization. Let's revisit each of them in more
detail to describe how organizations may want to reconsider this process
for Power applications.

* **Rehost**: Prior to {{site.SoA}}, there was not an easy way to rehost
    an application in Azure or another hyperscale provider. The "next
    best" option was to run Power applications in a colocation provider
    with a direct connection to the Cloud provider of choice. This has
    the disadvantage of having to still maintain physical
    infrastructure. {{site.SoA}} allows you move those workloads into
    Azure directly while maintaining the ability for them to run on **Native** IBM Power hardware. At the same time, these workloads are
    in close proximity to their {{site.Brand}} x86, Azure x86 and Azure native
    Cloud Services which allows for continued high-performance and
    easier manageability. Rehost is essentially a new option for Power
    workloads that didn't exist before in hyperscale Cloud providers
    that is now a new reality with {{site.SoA}}.

* **Refactor**: With the ability to run Power based applications in
    Azure, the amount of refactoring you must do is greatly diminished.
    You can re-host the Power based application components that don't
    lend themselves well to refactoring or would be too expensive to do
    so. Other components that are running on x86 such as a web-server,
    or application server can be refactored to running on Cloud-based
    x86 or Cloud-native solutions.

* **Rearchitect**: It is beneficial to run large applications where the Power
    component is the "system of record" natively in {{site.SoA}}.
    Examples include IBM i applications that are used for logistics or
    warehouse management where 90% of the application can be
    Rearchitected to create a next-gen mobile application, or one that
    leverages AI. Instead of taking the time and incurring expenses to Rearchitect
    the Power based component, it can simply live side-by-side with its
    Cloud-native components.

* **Rebuild**: There are plenty of IBM Power applications that are
    meeting user needs today and tomorrow. If there is a Cloud-first
    strategy, does it make sense to rebuild it to be cloud-native?
    Instead of rebuilding it, it can simply be rehosted in {{site.Brand}} on
    Azure.


Once you understand your IBM Power estate, you can start the
process of discovery to determine what and how you will be migrating to
{{site.SoA}}.
